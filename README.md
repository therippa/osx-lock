# OSX-LOCK

### This is how lazy I am
My current first-world problem is when I go from the computer to the couch to watch TV, sometimes I forget to lock my computer, so the blaring screens reflect off my awesome 4K TV right into the center of my field of vision.  I wanted to be able to turn off (lock) my monitors from my phone so I wouldn't have to get my ass off the couch, so I made this.

#### Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Use something to run `flask run` as a daemon (I use supervisord)
4. Create a shortcut/bookmark on your phone navigate to the http://address:port the flask server
